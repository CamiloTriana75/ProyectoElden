## 🔥 Firebase Configuration

**IMPORTANT**: For the application to work correctly, you need to configure Firebase. Follow the detailed instructions in [FIREBASE_SETUP.md](./FIREBASE_SETUP.md).

### Quick Summary:
1. Create a project in [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable Authentication (Email/Password)
3. Create a Firestore database
4. Copy configuration to `src/services/firebase.ts`

## 👥 User Roles

### Client
- Create account and profile
- View available fields
- Make reservations
- View reservation history
- Cancel own reservations

### Employee
- Everything from client role
- Manage other users' reservations
- View basic reports
- Configure field schedules

### Administrator

## 🗄️ Database

The application uses Firebase Firestore with the following collections:

- **users**: Registered users
- **reservations**: Made reservations
- **fields**: Available fields

## 🔄 Migration from IndexedDB

If you had the previous version with IndexedDB:

1. **Local data will be lost** - Firebase is a cloud database
2. **Configure Firebase** following the instructions
3. **Users will need to register again**
4. **Reservations will start from scratch**

### Migration Benefits:
- ✅ Centralized database
- ✅ Real-time between users
- ✅ Persistent data
- ✅ Scalability
- ✅ Enhanced security
